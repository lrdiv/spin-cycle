So, you spent all your money on records, and now you can't decide which one to listen to next...

Spin Cycle sends you a randomly selected record (or CD! or cassette! or whatever!) from your collection on Discogs every morning.

- We make sure to cycle through your entire collection before we send a duplicate
- You can select a specific sub-collection in Discogs for recommendations
- Tell us you didn't listen to something and we'll put it back in the mix

### TODO:

- [x] Authentication with Discogs
- [ ] Messaging (SMTP)
- [ ] Scheduling
- [ ] History UI
- [ ] Settings UI (custom time, collection)
- [ ] Donation-based SMS option (?)
